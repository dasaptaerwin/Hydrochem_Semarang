# Introduction
The following repository contains code and data set for hydrochemical analysis in Semarang area. I am working on it with Dr. Thomas Adi Putranto from Dept. of Geology, Universitas Diponegoro. 

# The analysis
This project will rely mosty on multivariaten analysis:

+ cluster analysis
+ principal component analysis
+ multiple regression:

    + decision tree
    + mgcv
    + randomForest

# References
We used various references and resource as the basis of our code, but mostly we gather it up from Github accounts.
